## Features 🙈

- Dynamic display:
  The fruit list is dynamically displayed thanks to the use of state React and the reusable Fruits component.

- Easy addition :
  The FruitForm form lets you quickly add new fruits. It's designed to be simple and efficient.

- Intuitive deletion:
  The handleDelete function in the main App component enables instant deletion of selected fruits.

## Code structuring 🫥

- Main component (App.js): Manages global status, fruit deletion and integrates Fruits and FruitForm components.

- Fruits component: Displays each fruit with a delete button. Reused for each item in the list.

- FruitForm component: Manages the fruit addition form for a seamless user experience.
